# Windows-Automation

What is the purpose of doing a job?
The purpose of doing anything is to be never have to do it ever again.

That's the motivation which has driven me to create this repository.

Here in I am recording the automations which I have implemented to never have to be able to work again.

All of the code which is available on this repo has been stripped of its local context and only a high level view exists to provide privacy of the work which was done in the local context.


## Ways of doing automation in windows
1. Batch Scripting
2. Developing Macros for Excel
3. Python Programming
